# Paddy-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Using-SVM-Classifier
Paddy Leaf Disease Detection Using SVM Classifier - Matlab Code

Objective
---------

* To detect paddy leaf disease portion from image.
* To extract features of detected portion of leaf.
* To recognize detected portion of leaf through SVM.

Proposed System
---------

* Motivation
    * For decrease the sufferings of people in agricultural field as like paddy culture by leaf disease detection and recognition process.

* The proposal
    * Preprocessing the input image
    * Detection and feature extraction of individual leaf
    * Recognition of the disease portion of paddy leaf
